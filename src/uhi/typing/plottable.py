Using the protocol:

Producers: use isinstance(myhist, PlottableHistogram) in your tests; part of
the protocol is checkable at runtime, though ideally you should use MyPy; if
your histogram class supports PlottableHistogram, this will pass.

Consumers: Make your functions accept the PlottableHistogram static type, and
MyPy will force you to only use items in the Protocol.
