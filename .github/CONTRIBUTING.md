# Quick run with Nox

If you have nox, this project supports nox. These are the supplied sessions:

```console
nox -s lint
nox -s tests
nox -s docs
nox -s build
```


# Post setup

You should prepare pre-commit, which will help you by checking that commits
pass required checks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit # or brew install pre-commit on macOS
pre-commit install # Will install a pre-commit hook into the git repo
```

You can also/alternatively run `pre-commit run` (changes only) or `pre-commit
run --all-files` to check even without installing the hook.

# Testing

Use pytest to run the unit checks:

```bash
pytest
```
