UHI: Unified Histogram Interface
=================================

UHI is a library that helps connect other Histogramming libraries. It is
primarily indented to be a guide and static type check helper; you do not need
an runtime dependency on UHI. It currently does so with the following
components:

UHI Indexing, which describes a powerful indexing system for histograms,
designed to extend standard Array indexing for Histogram operations.

UHI Indexing+ (referred to as UHI+ for short), which describes a set of
extensions to the standard indexing that make it easier to use on the command
line.

The PlottableProtocol, which describes the minimal and complete set of
requirements for a source library to produce and a plotting library to consume
to plot a histogram, including error bars.
