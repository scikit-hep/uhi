# Serialization


## Introduction

Histogram serialization has to cover a wide range of formats. As such, we
describe a form for serialization that covers the metadata structure as
JSON-like, with a provided JSON-schema. The data (bins and/or variable edges)
is stored out-of-band in a binary format based on what type of data file you
are in. For very small (primarily 1D) histograms, data is allowed inline as
well.

The following formats are being targeted:

```
┌──────────────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌────────────┐
│  ROOT (todo) │ │  HDF5  │ │  ZIP/JSON  │
└──────────────┘ └────────┘ └────────────┘
```

Other formats can be used as well, assuming they support out-of-band data and
text attributes or files for the metadata. We are working on a Zarr backend in
the near future.

## Caveats

This structure was based heavily on boost-histogram, but it is intended to be
general, and can be expanded in the future as needed. As such, the following
limitations are required:

* Serialization followed by deserialisation may cause axis changes. Axis types
  may change to an equivalent but less performant axis, growth status will be
  lost, etc. Libraries can record custom `"writer_info"` attributes to improve
  round trips, but histograms must always be openable without the extra info.
* Metadata should also be reasonably sized; some formats like HDF5 may limit
  the size of attributes to 64K.
* Floating point errors could be incurred on conversion, as the storage format
  uses a stable but different representation.
* Axis `name` is only part of the metadata, and is not standardized. This is
  due to lack of support from boost-histogram.

## Design

The following axes types are supported:

* `"regular"`: A regularly spaced set of even bins. Boost-histogram's "integer"
  axes maps to this axis as well. Has `upper`, `lower`, `bins`, `underflow`,
  `overflow`, and `circular` properties.
* `"variable"`: A continuous axis defined by bins+1 edges. Has `edges`, which
  is either an in-line list of numbers or a string pointing to an out-of-band data source.
  Also has `underflow`, `overflow`, and `circular` properties.
* `"category_int"`: A list of integer bins, non-continuous. Has `categories`,
  which is an in-line list of integers. Also has `flow`.
* `"category_str"`: A list of string bins. Has `categories`,
  which is an in-line list of strings. Also has `flow`.
* `"boolean"`: A true/false axis.

Axes with gaps are currently not supported.

All axes support `metadata`, a string-valued dictionary of arbitrary data.
Currently, strings, numbers, and booleans are supported. Other values here are
not currently supported. Libraries are encouraged to provide a way to indicate
unserializable metadata; our recommendation is to avoid adding any metadata
that starts with a `@` to the metadata dictionary. Libraries should not
include keys with `None` values, as some formats might not support null values.

The following storages are supported:

* `"int"`: A collection of integers. Boost-histogram's `Int64` and `AtomicInt64`
  map to this, and sometimes `Unlimited`.
* `"double"`: A collection of 64-bit floating point values. Boost-histogram's
  `Double` storage maps to this, and sometimes `Unlimited`.
* `"weighted"`: A collection of two arrays of 64-bit floating point values,
  `"value"` and `"variance"`. Boost-histogram's `Weight` storage maps to this.
* `"mean"`: A collection of three arrays of 64-bit floating point values,
  "`count"`, `"value"`, and `"variance"`. Boost-histogram's `Mean` storage maps to
  this.
* `"weighted_mean"`: A collection of four arrays of 64-bit floating point
  values, `"sum_of_weights"`, `"sum_of_weights_squared"`, `"values"`, and
  `"variances"`. Boost-histogram's `WeightedMean` storage maps to this.

A library can fill the optional `"writer_info"` field with a key specific to
the library containing library specific metadata anywhere a metadata field is
allowed. There is one defined key at the Histogram level, `"version"`, which
contains the version of the library that created the histogram. Libraries
should include this key when creating a histogram. It is not required for
reading histograms.  Histogram libraries can put custom metadata here that they
can use to record province information or help with same-library round trips.
For example, a histogram created with boost-histogram might contain:

```json
{
  "writer_info": {
    "boost-histogram": {
      "version": "1.0.0",
    }
  }
  ...,
}
```

There is one more required top-level key: `"uhi_schema"`, which must be set to
1 currently. If there is a future revision with a backward incompatible change,
this will be bumped to 2, and readers should always error on future schemas,
and support all older schemas. This is hoped to be unlikely/rare, but this also
serves as a check that this is in fact a uhi serialization object. Non-breaking
changes like additions are allowed without bumping the schema.

## Sparse storage

For sparse histograms, storage contains an `index` key. This is a 2D array; the
first dimension has the same number of entries as the number of axes, and the
second dimension has the same number of entries as the number of filled bins.
There should not be any duplicate entries. The values start at 0 for the
underflow bin (if there is one), and are in the same order as the axes. The
data in this case are 1D arrays, one for each bin. For example, take the
following sparse histogram with three filled bins:

```json
{
    "storage": {
        "index": [[0, 1, 2],[3, 3, 4]],
        "values": [5, 6, 7],
    }
}
```

The `0, 3` bin is filled with 5, the `1, 3` bin is filled with 6, and the `2,
4` bin is filled with 7. If the first axes has `"underflow"` enabled, that
first bin is an underflow bin.

If a histogram library doesn't support sparse histograms, you can convert a
sparse histogram to a dense one. UHI provides helpers `uhi.io.to_sparse` and
`uhi.io.from_sparse` that can be used to support a library that doesn't support
sparse histograms. Scalar histograms (with no axes) are always dense.


## CLI/API

You can currently test a JSON file against the schema by running:

```console
$ python -m uhi.schema some/file.json
```

Or with code:

```python
import uhi.schema

with filename.open(encoding="utf-8") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

uhi.schema.validate(data)
```

Eventually this should also be usable for JSON's inside zip, HDF5 attributes,
and maybe more.


## Format specific details and helpers

The `uhi` library contains reference implementations of target formats. You can
implement these yourself, but if you are using or have access to Python, feel
free to use `uhi` if that helps.

If an object has a `_to_uhi_` method, that will be used to convert it to a
dictionary following the schema. A `_from_uhi_` classmethod is also
recommended; however, this is generally part of the histogram constructor; if a
UHI object is passed, it should be converted automatically.

### JSON

The simplest format, useful for writing tests. The JSON version is nearly
identical to the intermediate representation; the only difference is that data
is stored as nested lists. It is not intended for large histograms; the ZIP
format (below) is nearly identical and builds on this with out-of-band data.

Two utilities are provided; `uhi.io.json.default` and
`uhi.io.json.object_hook`. These are used with Python's built-in json module to
handle conversions.

```python
import json
import uhi.io.json

ob = json.dumps(h, default=uhi.io.json.default)
uhi_hist = json.loads(ob, object_hook=uhi.io.json.object_hook)
```

Above, `h` is a histogram that supports `_to_uhi_` or an intermediate
representation,`ob` is a JSON string, and `uhi_hist` is an intermediate
representation; you can pass it to `boost_histogram.Histogram` or `hist.Hist`.


### ZIP

The zip format is very similar to JSON, but stores data in the numpy zip format.
Arrays are replaced by strings, which represent the `.npy` file inside the zip file
containing the array. The names are arbitrary; see the uhi code if you want to see
how uhi creates names. The metadata is in a file with the name of the histogram and
a `.json` extension.

We provide `uhi.io.json.write` and `uhi.io.json.read`, which work with open zip
files from the standard library (or probably anything with a similar API).

```python
import zip
import uhi.io.zip

with zip.open("myfile.zip", "w") as z:
    uhi.io.zip.write(zip_file, "histogram", h)

with zip.open("myfile.zip", "r") as z:
    h2 = uhi.io.zip.read(zip_file, "histogram")
```

Above, `h` is a histogram that supports `_to_uhi_` or an intermediate
representation, and`uhi_hist` is an intermediate representation; you can pass
it to `boost_histogram.Histogram` or `hist.Hist`. The metadata name in the file
is `"histogram.json"`. The contents of that file are identical to the JSON
format, except arrays are replaced by string names to files inside the zipfile.

### HDF5

The HDF5 format is ideal for combining histograms with other data. You need the
`h5py` library installed too to use this format. There is some extra structure
here compared to the other formats. The groups are `"axes"`, `"ref_axes"`,
`"metadata"`, and `"storage"`. Arrays for the axes are placed in `"ref_axes"`,
since hdf5 doesn't have lists of arrays. Storage arrays are in-place. A
Reference type is used to link the axes array with the data. "`edges"` and
`"categories"` are datasets; the other axes values are attributes (or groups
with attributes, like `"metadata"` and `"writer_info"`, which is a nested
group).

Likewise, the `"storage"` group sets `"type"` as an attribute, the others are
datasets.

We provide `uhi.io.hdf5.read` and `uhi.io.hdf5.write` to write to an open
group.  The structure is relative; you can place it anywhere inside a hdf5
file.

```python
with h5py.File("myfile.hdf5", "w") as h5_file:
    uhi.io.hdf5.write(h5_file.create_group("histogram"), h)

with h5py.File("myfile.hdf5", "r") as h5_file:
    h2 = uhi.io.hdf5.read(h5_file["histogram"])
```

Above, `h` is a histogram that supports `_to_uhi_` or an intermediate
representation, and`uhi_hist` is an intermediate representation; you can pass
it to `boost_histogram.Histogram` or `hist.Hist`. You should create the group
you want the histogram to be in.

<!-- TODO: make sure writer_info is stored, and make sure it's a nested group (via schema too) -->

### ROOT

ROOT files are not yet implemented.

## Schema

A typing helper for the intermediate representation, `HistogramIR`, is provided
in `uhi.typing.serialization` as a `TypedDict`. The schema, provided in
`resources` as `histogram.schema.json`, also allows strings for data members,
since some formats (like ZIP) put data into an optimized location and specify a
reference to them.
